# Legal Cloud Navigator - Project Summary

## Overview
Legal Cloud Navigator is a web application designed to streamline legal services by providing an intuitive platform for clients to manage legal documents, access AI-powered legal assistance, and connect with legal professionals. The platform serves different user roles (clients and legal professionals) with tailored experiences.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: For type safety throughout the codebase
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library providing accessible UI elements
- **React Router**: For client-side routing
- **Lucide React**: For scalable vector icons

### Backend & Services
- **Firebase Authentication**: For user authentication and session management
- **Firebase Hosting**: For deploying and serving the web application
- **Firebase Firestore** (planned): For database storage

## Architecture

### Component Structure
The application follows a feature-based organization with the following structure:
```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── auth/           # Authentication related components
│   ├── layout/         # Layout components like Navbar
│   ├── legal/          # Legal service specific components 
│   └── ui/             # Shadcn UI components
├── lib/                # Utility libraries and configuration
│   ├── firebase.ts     # Firebase configuration
│   └── utils.ts        # Utility functions
├── pages/              # Application pages (view components)
│   ├── auth/           # Authentication pages (login, register)
│   ├── cases/          # Case management pages
│   ├── dashboard/      # Dashboard pages
│   └── legal/          # Legal services pages
└── App.tsx             # Root application component with routing
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User navigates to login/register page
2. Firebase authentication handles credential verification
3. On successful authentication:
   - User session is established
   - Role-based information is stored in localStorage
   - User is redirected to the dashboard

### Application Flow
1. Anonymous users land on the homepage with marketing content
2. Users can register or login to access protected features
3. Authenticated users are directed to their role-specific dashboard
4. Users can access various services through the navigation menu:
   - Document management
   - AI legal assistant
   - Case tracking
   - Professional connection
